## Overview
Ackermann steering condition arises when axes of all wheels in a vehicle intersect
at a single turning point. In the case of Ackermann steering the wheels of the vehicle do not skid while turning as opposed to parallel steering. This reduces the tyre wear and increases the energy efficiency. Ackermann steering can be used in various autonomous systems such as self-driving cars, delivery robots which can increase the efficiency of the robot.

During the development the following assumptions
are made:
- All robot parameters are known.
- Initially the robot is on the origin of the world frame facing the x axis.
- Robot‚Äôs desired heading and velocity are given by the user as input.
- Maximum steering angle is 45 degrees.
- Friction and wheel slippage are considered negligible.

## Working
As the vehicle travels along a curved path, all four tyres follow unique trajectories around a shared turn centre, as defined by the blue arcs shown below.

For a given turn radius R, wheelbase L, and track width T, the required front steering angles (Œ¥_(f,in) and Œ¥_(f,out)) with the following expressions .And Similarly, we can calculate the wheel speeds using the following equations, where desired drive speed is denoted by ùëΩùë´ while ùëΩùëπùë≠, ùëΩùë≥ùë≠ are front right and left wheel speed., ùíç denotes the length of vehicle, ùíÖ denotes the distance between wheel and kinematic centre and ùùã is steer angle.

-------------------
## Risk and Mitigations
- Robot can't go in backward direction. For this case can implement more cases instead of just go around by making a full turn in forward direction
- The desired heading & speed sometimes overshoots and maintain steady state error. For this can be resolved by tuning PID gains. 
-  User can't give input heading in negative instead have to give positive value from 0-3.14 (in radians).
-------------------
## Results
For a specific set of inputs, the desired speed and the desired heading angle is acheived within expected range of +-5%. Example shown below with convergence for input as 0.1 and 5 for desired heading and speed and output with each forward wheel velocities and angles.
